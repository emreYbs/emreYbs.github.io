## Welcome to my notes about a cybersecurity Bootcamp, _Picus Security Bootcamp_, I have attended.

- I will share my lecture notes, articles I have read during Coursera Courses and provide them for you for quick access.
- Also I use them this repo as an archive for myself, current and future Bootcamp attendants.
- 
I will also write a blog post and share it soon about current vulnerabilities.
