# Work in progress
## Welcome to my notes about a cybersecurity Bootcamp, namely "_Picus Security Bootcamp_", which  have attended recently.

- I will share my lecture notes, articles I have read, _as supplementary readings during Coursera Courses which we were supposed to complete,_
and provide them for you  _(for quick access)_
- Also this repo can be used as an archieve for myself and current/future Bootcamp attendants.

 
I will also write a blog post and share it soon about current vulnerabilities.
